## **Day 1 at college(INDUCTION PROGRAMME)**
The first day of our college started from 10th July, first prayer was held in Gurudwara which lasted for an hour and was blissful and then we had snack break and after that we got the folders from the table of our respective branch and we went to the auditorium.In the auditorium. Principal Dr. Sehajpal Singh welcomed us and told us about the college. Mr. Jeevandeep Singh inspired us and gave us tips, he suggested us to watch 10-12 minutes videos instead of 30 secs videos and explained the logic behind it and told us that in life we ‚Äã‚Äãhave to grab opportunities one by one. Later we have Mr. Rajeshwar Singh guided us a lot spiritually and mentally. Sir explained us his journeys through stories and even suggested the book "The laws of the spirit world" which taught us a lot. Dr. Surinderveer Singh also graced the occasion. And with this, listening to these great personalities made our first day of college a lot better.
